The statewide variation of yield and soil in Indiana

The yield difference between the Indiana and county average yield for corn in 2020 is plotted in this graph. The red lines show the county average lower than state average and the green lines show the counties with higher average yield than the entire state. The interesting aspect of this plot is the dominant parent material of each county is represented (refer the legend).
